CS 300: Data Structures and Algorithms – Reflection

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In these projects, I built a program to help academic advisors at ABC University manage computer science course information. The goal was to load, organize, and search through a list of courses efficiently using different data structures such as vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees.

How did you approach the problem?
I began by analyzing which data structure would best meet the needs of the problem. I designed pseudocode for each approach and compared their runtime and memory usage. Understanding data structures was crucial because each one provides trade-offs between speed, memory, and ease of access.

How did you overcome any roadblocks?
Some challenges I faced included fixing logic errors in tree traversal and dealing with file input issues in C++. I overcame these by using print statements for debugging, reviewing my algorithms carefully, and asking for clarification when needed.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project taught me the importance of planning before coding. Creating pseudocode and analyzing runtime helped me design solutions that were efficient and well-organized. It also showed how software design connects directly to performance.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I’ve learned to write cleaner code with consistent structure and comments so that it’s easier to maintain. Using modular functions and clear naming conventions has made my code easier to understand and reuse in future projects.
